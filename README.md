# Color-Explorer
A simple PCB to allow students to explore colors and mixing colors of light.

The board provides three slider potentiometers which each control the brightness of one color of light. There are four RGB LEDs. The first three show the individual color component as configured by the position of the sliders - one red, one blue, and one green. The fourth LED shows the mixed/combined colors. A jumper can be removed to disable the "mixed" LED, allowing students to set their sliders and make a hypothesis about what color will result from the mix. After recording their hypothesis, the jumper can be reinstalled to reveal the correct answer.
